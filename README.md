# Shell-Script-To-Install-Java-Jenkins-Ubuntu


You can then make the script executable using the following command:

## chmod +x install_jenkins.sh


After that, you can run the script using:

## sudo ./install_jenkins.sh


This script will install OpenJDK 11 and Jenkins on your Ubuntu server. It will also start the Jenkins service and display the initial admin password needed to complete the Jenkins setup through a web browser. Make sure to keep this password safe, as you'll need it during the initial setup process.
